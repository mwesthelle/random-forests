## For contributors
This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management (no
packaging (yet)). Install Poetry, clone the repo, cd into it and run `poetry install` to
work on the project.

## For running locally
Just run [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to test the project via a
Jupyter notebook by doing `docker-compose up`.
