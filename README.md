This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management (no packaging (yet)). Install Poetry,
clone the repo, cd into it and run `poetry install` to work on the project, or else just run the yet non-existent (:-D)
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file to test it via a Jupyter notebook.
